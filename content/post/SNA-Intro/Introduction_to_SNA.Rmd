This post contains links to our self-study course developed in conjunction with the [Center for Homeland Defenese and Security (CHDS)](https://www.chds.us). The course is an introduction to social network analysis (SNA); as such, we cover what SNA is and is not and how it differs from other approaches. We also introduce basic SNA terms, concepts and assumptions that undergird this field.
