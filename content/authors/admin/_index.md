The Department of Defense Analysis is home to the CORE (Common Operational Research Environment) Lab. CORE was established at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in 2007 with the mission to support U.S. and International field operatives in the analytical craft of integrating geospatial, cultural, relational, and temporal data.

This is our practioner's page, which contains a curated set of resources that we have developed for practioners and field operators. Our organizational site with further information on who we are can be found [here](https://my.nps.edu/web/core).
